    "*A dialogue between a cranky curmudgeon and an excitable quantum enthusiast as they leave a talk at a computing conference:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curmudgeon**: This quantum computing thing must be nonsense. My classical computers are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons just like quantum computers are. There's no magical fairy dust in a quantum computer, so there's no way that it could be more powerful than any classical one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum enthusiast**: Yes, the physical ingredients are the same, but classical computers ignore the fact that two quantum objects can be entangled. Quantum computers don't just notice quantum entanglement - they use it! That's the secret ingredient!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curmudgeon**: Quantum entanglement? That \"spooky action at a distance\" thing I read about in my youth in a physical encyclopedia?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The quantum enthusiast spends a few moments explaining entanglement and that no, the world has moved on from Einstein's skepticism about entanglement.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curmudgeon**: Well that's some very pretty math. But you're telling me that a quantum computer has to actually create and control entanglement. That's never going to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum enthusiast**: It already has! We already know how to do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Curmudgeon**: I don't believe you. Prove it!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum enthusiast**: You know, that's actually a fair point. Even if I handed you a couple of entangled qubits, how would you know that they were actually entangled?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use experiments on IQM's quantum computers to build the most convincing case possible that:\n",
    "1) You can prove that, for some state of the quantum computer, entanglement must actually be present\n",
    "2) You can successfully do #1 for a wide range of qualitatively distinct states of the quantum computer \n",
    "3) You can entangle a large number of qubits (the more the better)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then present your case to us curmudgeons! Well, simulated curmudgeons. We do work for a quantum computing company after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: there are many ways to achieve point 1. What will distinguish an adequate solution from an excellent solution is how well you can accomplish points 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Judging criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Theoretical correctness. Does the experiment actually demonstrate that entanglement must be present?\n",
    "2) Sophistication of the implementation. Have you optimized your circuits for the performance/architecture of the quantum computer?\n",
    "3) Number of qubits entangled.\n",
    "4) Flexibility of the experiment. Have you shown that entanglement is present in many different (orthogonal) states?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus points will be awarded for:\n",
    "- Scalable solutions - would your experiment be feasible on a new generation of quantum computers with many hundreds or even thousands of qubits?\n",
    "- Experimentally identifying the most important reason you can't entangle more qubits\n",
    "- Mitigating any loopholes that allow your experimental results to occur without entanglement being present \n",

    "## Why is this problem important?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem isn't just about convincing the skeptics. Entanglement is the \"secret sauce\" that gives quantum computing its biggest power boost, which means that running complex quantum algorithms will require creating large amounts of multipartite entanglement. In fact, some paradigms of quantum computing (like measurement-based quantum computing) actually assume that they can prepare a large, highly entangled quantum state before starting any algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that demonstrating large amounts of controllable entanglement is a critical benchmark to assess the performance of quantum computers. A good quantum computer had better be able to entangle lots of qubits! This is particularly true as we progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computation - logical qubits generally consist of many entangled physical qubits, and then we need to be able to entangle those logical qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what you're doing here is developing practical ways to quantitatively compare quantum computers' ability to create and maintain their most unique and important resource. That's a big deal!"

    "## Background - Measuring entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement refers to quantum correlations that cannot be realized in a classical system, specifically, a \"local hidden variables theory.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular way to describe entanglement is with the following (flimsy) argument. Imagine that Sam has prepared two qubits in the state\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{01}-\\ket{10}\\right)$$\n",
    "Then Sam sends one qubit each to distant, widely separated observers Alice and Bob. When Alice measures her qubit, she has no idea what she will measure (0 or 1). But after doing so, she will instantaneously know the state of Bob's qubit, despite not having Bob's qubit anywhere near her! This \"spooky action at a distance\" demonstrates entanglement!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this argument is extremely weak. Imagine that instead of qubits, Sam prepared two boxes, one with an apple in it and one with an orange in it, then randomly sends one box to Alice and one to Bob. When Alice opens her box, she will discover which fruit she has, and will instantly know which fruit Bob has. So does this mean that the fruit is entangled? Of course not. Boxed fruit doesn't behave quantum mechanically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to do something more subtle to see why entanglement is special.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHSH inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "One classic way to demonstrate that entanglement exists in quantum systems is through violation of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) inequality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that Sam sends pairs of objects to Alice and Bob, just as above. When Alice recieves an object, she can choose whether to measure either property $A_1$ or property $A_2$. Bob can choose whether to observe either property $B_1$ or property $B_2$. And all four properties can be either $\\pm 1$. Bob's properties may be the same as Alice's, correlated with Alice's, or totally unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2$ all actually have meaningful values for each object, and that Alice's measurements do not affect Bob's measurements (absence of entanglement).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can define a quantity\n",
    "$$S = A_1(B_1-B_2) + A_2(B_1+B_2)$$\n",
    "Clearly if $B_1=B_2$, then $S=\\pm 2 A_2$. And if $B_1 \\neq B_2$, then $S = \\pm 2 A_1$. So we conclude that $S$ is always equal to $\\pm 2$, so the average value $\\langle S \\rangle$ of $S$ must obey\n",
    "$$ \\left| \\left\\langle S \\right\\rangle \\right| \\leq 2$$\n",
    "This is the CHSH inequality. By being more careful about making statistical statements rather than statements about individual outcomes, it's not hard to generalize the argument above to when measuring $B_1$ affects the measurememnt of $B_2$. So the CHSH inequality only tells you something about how Alice's measurements are correlated with Bob's measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, imagine that the objects are qubits, $A_1$ is a measurement in the $Z$ basis, and $A_2$ is a measurement in the $X$ basis. If Bob makes the same measurements, except his measurement bases are rotated 45 degrees clockwise in the $xz$-plane from Alice's, you can check that\n",
    "$$\\bra{\\psi} S \\ket{\\psi} = -2\\sqrt{2} < -2$$\n",
    "So the CHSH inequality is badly violated by quantum mechanics! This experiment has been performed in a lab with many different qubit types, and it is evidence that there are non-classical correlations between qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entanglement tells us that the state of each qubit does not physically make sense; there is no such thing as \"the state of qubit 1\" and \"the state of qubit 2\" when entanglement is present. Instead, the only thing that makes sense is \"the combined state of qubits 1 and 2.\" Mathematically, this means that we cannot factor $\\ket{\\psi}$ into a product $\\ket{\\psi_1} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_2}$ of states for each qubit separately.\n"

    "\n",
    "CHSH and its generalizations, the *Bell inequalities*, tell you that entanglement is present between two qubits. However, this is not the only form of entanglement, and this challenge is really about *multipartite entanglement*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another classic example is the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state of three qubits:\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}\\right)$$\n",

    "In this case, there is no way to factor $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}$ into the product of a state for each qubit $\\ket{\\psi_1} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_2} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_3}$. But even more strongly, we cannot factor out *any* qubit's state; we can't write $\\ket{\\psi_{12}} \\otimes \\ket{\\psi_3}$ or any generalization thereof. This is called *multipartite entanglement*, describing correlations that are unique to many entangled qubits, not just two entangled qubits. Multipartite entanglement means that there is no way to meaningfully say that *any subset* of the qubits has its own well-defined state; the only well-defined state is the state of all the qubits together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the GHZ state to the state\n",

    "The first two qubits are entangled, but the last one is not entangled with anything (although it's in a superposition state). So this state is not multipartite entangled; it only has entanglement between the first two qubits.\n"
